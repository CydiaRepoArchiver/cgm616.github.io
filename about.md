I'm a highschool student in Minnesota who loves to tinker and experiment with thing. Especially breakable ones.

I build a computer in March 2014, and that's what I mostly use to program/do things. However, I'm in love with zsh, so I'm thinking about getting a cheap laptop for debian.

This is my blog for mostly anything. It will be very programming related, just as a heads up.  There also may not be posts frequently. No promises.
