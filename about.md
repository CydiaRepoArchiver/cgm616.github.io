<div class="eight columns" markdown="1">
I'm a highschool student in Minnesota who loves to tinker and experiment with things. Especially breakable ones.

I built a computer in March 2014, and that's what I mostly use to program/do things. I do really like unix environments, though, so I'm thinking about installing arch linux on some old laptop.

This blog will be about anything I feel like posting. I probably won't post very often. In addition, this blog will be a portfolio for a Digital Media course that I'm taking.
