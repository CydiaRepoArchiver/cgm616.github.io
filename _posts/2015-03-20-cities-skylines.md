I recently bought Cities: Skylines by Colossal Order, the new citybuilder game that came out recently.  It has
been widely praised, so I thought I'd give it a try.

And I really like it.  The gameplay is really different for me, quite low-key and not as high-strung as the
games I usually play.  I watched netflix as I played on my second monitor.  Despite this, it can become hard to
manage your city, especially with no experience, even beyond ten thousand inhabitants.  That really isn't on the
game though, that's just me not making good, self-sustaining cities.

Another thing the game comes with is amazing mod support.  On the Steam Workshop, there are countless mods,
fixing many small things the devs overlooked.  I have no doubt many will be added to the game as official
features.  Also on the workshop is tons of "assets" and savegames.  The assets part is really cool.  Because I
suck at making good highway interchanges, I could subscribe to one on the workshop and use their interchange in
my game.  Really nice, especially when mine all suck.  The savegames are interesting as well.  If I wanted, I
could download a complete recreation of the city in GTA: 4.  Somebody has made that, and they put it on the
workshop.

There aren't many problems with this game I could find, and of them, they are rather small things.  I wish that
drawing exact circles had some sort of guide, so I don't need to count the radius each time.  I also wish the
mock twitter feed at the top of the screen was less intrusive.  Wait! There's a mod for that!

All in all, I would recommend getting the game, even if it isn't your normal type of game.  I really enjoy it.  
Colossal Order did very well with this one.
