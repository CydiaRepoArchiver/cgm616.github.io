For school I recently had to read [White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack](https://www.isr.umich.edu/home/diversity/resources/white-privilege.pdf "article") by Peggy McIntosh.  It was quite interesting, and my views on both gender and racial inequality changed considerably after the article.

McIntosh makes a very good point, that empowered groups don't see themselves as advantaged, only oppressed groups as disadvantaged.  For me, that was very true. I didn't see myself, as a white male, as advantaged over others.  I only saw them as disadvantaged from me.  I also didn't see racism in my daily life very often.  I, of course, heard about the [shooting of Michael Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown "wikipedia") on the news, but I never observed it in my life.  However, the article changed that.

It talks about how racism is a subconscious thing, and I remembered back to a piece by Malcolm Gladwell about a study of subconscious racism, showing faces and asking the first word you think of.  It is much harder to see racism than to acknowledge that it exists somewhere.

I never realized how racist my life is.  How racist I am, despite my attempts to not be.
