I just made the next voxel thing. I actually like this one more, even though it was less complex. I feel like my modeling skills got better as I did this. In addition, I already knew the tools, so I was more easily able to get started. 

Also, for this one, I started playing around with the render settings in Magica Voxel. The silver metal is given metallic attributes, as well as a specular reflection. Same with the gold contacts. Everything else is simple a simple diffuse material.

Here's the render in all it's glory:
