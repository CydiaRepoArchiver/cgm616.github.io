I love running.

And by that, I mean just running.  The other day, for track, we had to do a light run around a nearby 3.1 mile lake.  I though to myself, "oh dang it, that sounds hard."  And it was.  I've never run that far at such a steady pace.  I play soccer, but that is more of an on and off run, not a uncompromising jog.

However, around the half mile mark, it began to feel good, the steadiness of it.  My breathing was steady, my jog was steady, and the ground just flew (according to me at least, I think I was actually running incredibly slow).  I didn't feel the need to walk, as long as I kept the same pace, which was good.

I can't wait to do it again.
