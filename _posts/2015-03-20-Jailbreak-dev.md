Developing for jailbroken devices is surprisingly easy, because of a great tool named Theos.  All it is is a collection of makefiles to help compile tweaks and put everything in the rght place, but it's really powerful.

Granted, I haven't done much with it other than develop a simple tweak to hook SpringBoard, but I'm going to make an up to date video tutorial hopefully soon in the future as for how to use it on windows.  

If you want to use Theos, you can find it at [github](https://github.com/dhowett/theos).  Just clone that and follow the instructions at the [iPhoneDevWiki](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page "wiki") on the [Theos Setup](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Setup "theos/setup") page.  You don't really even need Objective-C experience, just look up some examples on github.
