I finally added a Jekyll blog to my github pages user account. I've been wanting to do this for ages. 

It was really easy, just some repo merging to merge my cydia repo ([cgm616.github.io/repo](https://cgm616.github.io/repo "my cydia repo")) with Jekyll ([github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now "the awesome jekyll-now repo by Barry Clark")). It also looks really good.  

That will probably change though, as soon as I get my hands on the design.
