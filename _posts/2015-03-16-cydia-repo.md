As no one knows, I have a Cydia repo at [cgm616.github.io/repo](https://cgm616.github.io/repo "repo").  It doesn't have much now, but it will. Maybe. Soon(TM).

Just check back eventually.

For those of you who don't know what Cydia is and why I'm talking about it, head [here](https://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Cydia.app "iphonewiki cydia page").  It's a pretty cool thing to install on iOS devices.
