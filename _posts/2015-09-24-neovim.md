I just recently found out about neovim (http://github.com/neovim/neovim). Having not used vim in the past, I decided to try to learn how to use it as my main text editor.

This is going to be a hard task, because not only have I never used vim and always used nano, I also cannot touch type. I'm going to have to learn both of these skills in order to succeed.

It seems pretty cool though. Already I have it set up with a basic .nvimrc and solarized using pathogen. The next step for me is using it, in combination with tmux, as my entire editor and terminal manager.
