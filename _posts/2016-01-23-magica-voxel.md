I recently saw Magica Voxel posted on HN. I donwloaded it and started to play around a bit with it, just checking it out. I am in no way a skilled voxel artist, or artist at all, but it's still fun to make something from scratch. 

I ended up making a model of the Rubik's Cube that I keep on my desk. I like to think that it turned out pretty well. Here it is in all it's glory:![rubikscube.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/rubikscube.png)

I'm going to make a coin next, I think. After that I might try a scene.
